I designed a responsive product card using Bootstrap's grid layout and card components. The card includes a product image, name, price, and a variant dropdown with a dynamic "Add to Cart" or "Out of Stock" button. Since the provided API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) does not include variant options or stock availability, I manually added mock data for both to fulfill the test requirements and demonstrate the required UI functionality.

Please note:

The variant dropdown is for UI demonstration only and is not functionally connected to the cart logic.

The "Out of Stock" status is randomly assigned, so you may need to refresh the page to see different products marked as out of stock.

The layout is fully responsive and follows UI/UX best practices using Bootstrap classes.
